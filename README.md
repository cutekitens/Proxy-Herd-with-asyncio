# Proxy-Herd-with-asyncio

Project completed for Computer Science 131: Programming Languages taken in Fall 2021

The project was to write a report on if Python's asyncio library is effective in writing an application server herd. I did research on asyncio, coded a protoype of an application server herd using asyncio on a Linux server and discussed problems I had while coding it, compared asyncio to Node.js, and gave a recommendation on if I thought asyncio was effective for writing an application server herd based on what I had learned.
